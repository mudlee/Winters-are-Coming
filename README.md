# Winters are Coming

This little game was made for the first [Rush24](https://itch.io/jam/rush24) game jam using Unity.

## Gameplay

In this game, you have to survive as long as possible. 

It ain't be easy as you have enemies (Winters) who will catch you and you will die. The only question is when.

Fortunately, you can teleport from one colored spot to an another. Be ware though, teleports work ONLY if your color is the same! Also, teleport can only be used after 3 seconds since the last use.
